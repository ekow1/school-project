## 🎨 Code Quality

### Best Practices
✅ ES6+ syntax (import/export, async/await)
✅ Proper error handling with try-catch
✅ Mongoose virtuals for relationships
✅ Schema validation
✅ Index optimization
✅ Clean separation of concerns (MVC pattern)
✅ RESTful API design
✅ Consistent response format

### Controller Functions
Each controller exports:
- `create<Entity>()`
- `getAll<Entity>()`
- `get<Entity>ById()`
- `update<Entity>()`
- `delete<Entity>()`
- Additional helper functions where needed

### Response Format
```javascript
// Success
{
  success: true,
  message: "Operation completed successfully",
  data: { ... },
  count: 10  // for list operations
}

// Error
{
  success: false,
  message: "Error description"
}
```
